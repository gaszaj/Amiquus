Amiquus is a web application designed to notify users in real time about new car listings that match their specific criteria.
It monitors leading platforms for new and used vehicle listings, with additional platforms being added continuously.

Users can set detailed filters based on the type of vehicles they are interested in.
The monthly subscription starts at $99, with the final price depending on the number of platforms tracked and the selected monitoring frequency.

When a vehicle matching the user's criteria is found, Amiquus sends an instant Telegram notification that includes a photo of the vehicle and key details such as price, mileage, location, and contact phone number.

The service is particularly valued by individuals working in the used car dealership industry, where desirable listings at competitive prices are rare and competition is high.
Being the first to respond to a good listing can be the difference between profit and loss.
Amiquus automates the search process, removing the need to manually refresh multiple car listing platforms.

Subscriptions can be paused or canceled at any time.
Due to high demand and a focus on keeping users ahead of the competition, the number of active Amiquus slots is intentionally limited.
